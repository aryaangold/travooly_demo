    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Blues & Grays (Tailwind Sky, Slate) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is a dashboard with an interactive calendar as its core. A side panel contains strategic filters (by content type and pillar) and a summary chart, allowing users to analyze the content mix. Clicking a day on the calendar opens a modal with detailed post information, including a 'copy hashtags' feature. This structure transforms the static source table into a multi-dimensional analysis tool, enabling users to explore the plan chronologically, thematically, or by content format, which is far more usable for strategic planning and execution. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
    - Report Info: Travooly's 30-day content plan. Goal: Make the strategy interactive and easy to analyze.
    - Viz/Presentation 1: Interactive Calendar Grid (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: Click for details, hover highlights. Justification: Most intuitive way to view a monthly schedule.
    - Viz/Presentation 2: Content Type Donut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hover tooltips, legend toggles. Justification: Provides a quick, data-driven summary of the content format distribution.
    - Viz/Presentation 3: Detail Modal (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction: View full copy, copy hashtags to clipboard. Justification: Offers a focused view of a single post's content without losing context of the overall calendar.
    - Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation and state management, Chart.js for data visualization. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
